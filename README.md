Aiming at the challenges of weak respiratory and heartbeat signals, susceptibility to non-stationary interferences (e.g., electromagnetic pulses, limb micro-motions), and respiratory harmonic aliasing, this study innovatively constructs a phase modulation model for millimeter-wave radar vital signs, quantifies the time-frequency coupling mechanism between target signals and non-stationary interferences, and proposes a dual-domain joint optimization framework. This framework constrains the time-domain sparsity of non-stationary interferences using the frequency-domain harmonic sparsity of vital signs, enabling the efficient separation of respiratory and heartbeat signals from non-stationary interferences. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm reduces the heart rate error to 0.48-1.06 BPM within a detection range of 1-2.5 metersâ€”an improvement of 58.3% compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the average heartbeat interval error is reduced to as low as 6.5 ms, demonstrating strong robustness across various physiological characteristics. These findings provide a theoretical and technical foundation for non-contact, high-precision vital signs monitoring and promote the application of millimeter-wave radar in smart medicine and health monitoring.
